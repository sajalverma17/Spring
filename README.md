# Spring

Spring is an Android app that breaks the subscription system of an Indian music streaming service, allowing anyone to download any song without subscription or decrypt the songs that were saved for offline listening by subscribed users.

Uses client-side decryption combined with some web-scraping to exploit a vulnerability.
