# Spring

Spring is an Android app that breaks the subscription system of an Indian music streaming service, allowing anyone to download any song without subscription or decrypt songs saved for offline listening by subscribed users.

Written in Java and Kotlin, this is a POC on a vulnerability.

If you are a subscribed user, decrypt songs that are saved offline to get the original .mp3 file on your phone

Or simply download a song by sharing it with Spring.
